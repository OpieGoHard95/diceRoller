Dice Rolling problem that you assigned in class

Did my first attempt after a while of Googling however I still cannot understand why it didn't work. After recieving error codes from this I looked at other people's in the classes code, most notably Andrew's because he attempted the problem in a similar fashion to me. The code still does not work so I will continue to work on it. - 2/11/15

Needed to take the function out I found after chasing a couple threads on stackoverflow. The program now runs and I would say most of the problem was still done on my own accord, I just needed help the few times I got stuck. I am still curious however as to why it would not work as a function. - later 2/11/15
